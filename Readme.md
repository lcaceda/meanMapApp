This is my first take at a MEAN App.
It currently only works locally but I hope to have it up on AWS shortly seeing as the heroku iteration was a flop: https://crowdsourcebikeshare.herokuapp.com/.

The inspiration for this app is the recently launched Atlanta Bike Share System. I thought, why not play with making a crowdsourced bike share app.

Technologies used:
Mongo
Express
NodeJS
AngularJS
Google Maps

Resources used: 
Scotch.io

Future interests:
The app needs more features: log in, gallery, chat feature, and profile pages.
